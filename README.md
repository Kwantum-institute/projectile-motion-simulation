# Physics Simulation

This repository is based on the [Physics Simulation](https://github.com/rentsdue/physics-simulation) project, written in Python instead of JS and HTML. It contains a web-based projectile motion simulation created using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript.

## Description

This simulation demonstrates the basic principles of projectile motion, including gravity and motion dynamics. A ball is launched with an initial velocity, and its trajectory is visualized in real-time on the canvas. The simulation includes the effects of gravity, bouncing, and ground interaction.

## How to Use

To run the simulation:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

2. Observe the projectile motion of the ball and its interaction with the ground.
